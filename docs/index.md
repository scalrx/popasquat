### About

Popasquat is an Android application that allows users to view surrounding locations and select a restroom based on ratings.

Upon launch of the application, the user is greeted with a map where they can find markers on a map where ratings for a bathroom have been placed.

The user then has the ability to tap on any given marker to view ratings for a particular place, as well as see featured pictures and the address!
